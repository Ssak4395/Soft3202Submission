/**
 * Basically two patterns have been applied here, firstly I have applied the value object design pattern
 *
 * Dot Points targeted
 *
 * 1.The system uses a LOT of RAM. Analysis has indicated this is due to the Report class, which
 * stores a lot of data. CPA would like you to solve this RAM issue somehow, without breaking the
 * existing use of the Report interface.
 * ReportImpl has been included in your module scope to assist with this,
 * but ReportDatabase is a fake fa√ßade on a remote database that you cannot change.
 *
 * 2.Because the Report object captures data without any consistent primary key, and because people have duplicated object names and versions,
 * any time reports need to be compared for equality we have to remember to check many fields. CPA would like you to make this process simpler.
 *
 *
 * Design pattern Applied Flyweight
 *
 * Intent: The intent of this pattern is to use sharing to support a large number of objects that have part of their internal state in common where the other part of state can vary.
 *
 * Consequences: Lower RAM usage
 *
 * This pattern was used to ensure equality between reports could be compared much more easily, to do this
 * I used a Guava ImmutableArray, since creating a unmodifiable array natively is a pain
 *
 * Design pattern applied Value Object
 *
 * Intent:A Value Object is an immutable type that is distinguishable only by the state of its properties.
 *
 * Consequences: Comparing two reports is now much more simple, contents of the report cannot be altered.
