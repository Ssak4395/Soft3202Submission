/**
 *
 * Dot Point Targeted: The current method of handling client contact methods is quite bulky â€“ CPA  would like you to streamline this somehow.
 *
 *
 * The Chain of Responsibility Pattern was used over here, previously I thought it would of been better to utilize,
 * the strategy pattern, but this is not the case, if you take a look at the Feaafacade, it is very evident that we are following
 * a chain like heirarchy.
 *
 * Intent: Declutter and streamline this class
 *
 * Consequences: The contact methods are now all intertwined by implementors of chainable interface.
